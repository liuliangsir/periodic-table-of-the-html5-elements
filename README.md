This is a periodic table for the HTML5 elements. Inspired by another demos, [Periodic Table of Elements - HTML/CSS](https://codepen.io/ankit567/pen/wxbYXE) and [Periodic Table of the HTML5 Elements](http://www.xuanfengge.com/funny/html5/element/).

## Getting Started

These instructions below will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. See [deployment section](#deployment) for more details on how to deploy the project on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or your own deploy environment like Ubuntu.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
- nvm - [Download & Install nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). You might need to install an alternative tool([nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)/[nodist](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist)) if you are a Windows user.

### Installing

- Clone this repository to your local machine with **https** or **ssh**

- Install npm packages

```shell
npm ci
```

## Deployment

It is most convenient for users who have forked the github repository and would like to deploy the project on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), since that github repository takes full advantage of [Github Action](https://developer.github.com/actions/) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/). So you only need to do one thing that is pushing the file changes in local master branch to remote repository, whether you are ready to use which solution.

Note: you might need to provide the following variables: `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `PUBLIC_PATH`. Check out [github-action-gh-pages](https://github.com/nchaulet/github-action-gh-pages/tree/master) for more details on how to deploy a directory on github pages with [Github Action](https://developer.github.com/actions/).
